# ia_manager

A minimal command-line tool to manage personal projects with a simple AI-based planner.

The interactive shell now uses a few ANSI colors. If needed, install `colorama`
with `pip install colorama`.

Run `python -m ia_manager` to start the interactive shell. Type `help` inside
the shell to see available commands.
